    <h1>Privacy Policy for Daily DM Booster</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: August 23, 2025</div>
    <p>Your privacy is of utmost importance to us at <strong>Super Amazing Creations</strong>. This Privacy Policy outlines how Daily DM Booster ("the App") collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Daily DM Booster collects certain non‑personally identifiable information and user‑generated content to provide and improve its services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anonymous User IDs:</strong> We use Google Firebase Anonymous Authentication to generate a unique, anonymous user ID for each user. This ID is used to store your app data and preferences, and does not directly identify you.</li>
      <li><strong>User‑Generated Content:</strong> Content you create or import within the App, such as DMs, emails, favorite prompts, and preferences, is stored. This includes text, niche, tone, goal, and other related metadata.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect aggregated, anonymized data about app usage (e.g., number of generations, feature usage) to improve app performance and features. This does not identify you personally.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. AI Content Generation and Data Handling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>DM and email generation is processed through OpenAI's API.</li>
      <li>Your OpenAI API key is used locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties other than OpenAI.</li>
      <li>OpenAI has its own data policies. Please review OpenAI’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for details.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Data Storage and Anonymous Usage</h2>
    <p>The App uses Google Firebase Firestore to store generated content (DMs, emails), favorites, and preferences. This data is associated with your anonymous user ID. You can export and import your data as JSON files for manual backup.</p>
    <h2>4. In‑App Purchases (Google Play Billing)</h2>
    <p>Purchases are processed by Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store payment details. Transactions are subject to Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable safeguards to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of your information and usage data.</p>
    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time by posting the new version on this page. Please review periodically for changes.</p>
    <h2>8. Contact Us & Data Deletion Requests</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or if you wish to request the deletion of your data associated with your anonymous user ID, please contact us at:</p>
    <p><a href="mailto:privacy@superamazingcreations.com">privacy@superamazingcreations.com</a></p>
